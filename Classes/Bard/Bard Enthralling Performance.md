**Bard Enthralling Performance**  
*By Marcus#3244 ("I did a thing! silverbass#2407 didn't help at all!" >.>)*  
  
Just a simple embed for the Glamour Bard's Enthralling Performance. Fills in with the correct number of people affected and your spell save DC, and marks off the 1/day counter. This text has been abbreviated slightly from the book version for ease of digestion during play.
