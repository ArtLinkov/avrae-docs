# Fighter

Avrae is a powerful D&D 5E Discord bot used to make rolls and streamline playing online. This list includes commands (aliases and snippets) for the fighter class.

## Creating a Fighter

First, [create a character sheet](#creating-a-character). 

Now, scroll down and find the commands you want. You do not need to use every command here, but many automate tasks such as counter tracking and regaining hit points such as Second Wind. They also include a description and a page number to find each feature.

When you find a command you want, copy the text in the **Code** box. Paste and send the text in a channel Avrae can read, or in Direct Messages to it. If there are two code blocks, use the **DiceCloud** box if your sheet is on DiceCloud. Otherwise, use the **Alternative** box.

To change the command name, replace the word following ``alias`` or ``snippet`` such as ``bsw`` in ``!alias bsw``. To use an alias, type the command name, such as ``!bsw``. To use a snippet, type ``!a weapon snippet``, replacing ``weapon`` with a weapon on your character sheet, and ``snippet`` with the name of your snippet.

If there is a **Prerequisites** box, paste and send that command as well. Fill out any fields the description asks of you. You do not need to do this if you are using a DiceCloud sheet and you linked your features to your counters as described in [Creating a Character](#creating-a-character).

#### Quick Build

You can set up your fighter aliases quickly by clicking this [link](#creating-a-quick-fighter) and following the directions there.

#### Multiclassing with Alternative Sheets

If you are multiclassing with a non-DiceCloud sheet, run the following command, replacing ``flvl`` with your current fighter level.

```GN
!cvar FighterLevel flvl
```

If there are two boxes of code, use the DiceCloud box instead of the Alternative box. **IMPORTANT:** In addition, whenever you gain a level in fighter, run the command again, replacing ``flvl`` with your new fighter level. This will update all of your aliases with your new fighter level.

#### (Optional) Color

You can also set up a color by sending the following code to Avrae, replacing ``hex`` with a [color hex code](https://www.webpagefx.com/web-design/color-picker/). Do not include the hashtag (#). You do not need to run this for commands to function properly.

```GN
!multiline
!csettings color hex
!cvar color hex
```

# Class Features

As a fighter, you have the following aliases and snippets.

## Hit Dice (d10)

Displays text and page number for Hit Dice. Subtracts from Hit Dice counter and rolls hit dice, then adds result rolled to current hit points. Returns error if attempting to spend more hit dice than remaining.

#### Prerequisites

A DiceCloud feature called "Hit Dice (d10)" with ``FighterLevel`` number of uses. Do not include ``short rest`` or ``long rest`` in your feature, as you only regain half your Hit Dice on a long rest.

Alternatively, run the following code, replacing ``flvl`` with your current fighter level. **IMPORTANT:** Whenever you gain a level in fighter, run this command again.

```GN
!cc create "Hit Dice (d10)" -min 0 -max flvl -type default
```

To reset your hit dice, you can run the following alias. Usage is ``!hdr die num``, replacing ``die`` with a die size (such as ``d10``), and ``num`` with a number, such as ``3``. An example of this is ``!hdr d10 3``.

```GN
!alias hdr embed {{mod_cc("Hit Dice (%1%)", %2%)}} -title "<name> regains spent Hit Dice!" -desc "At the end of a long rest, you regain spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half your total number of them." -f "Hit Dice (%1%)|{{get_cc("Hit Dice (%1%)")}} / {{get_cc_max("Hit Dice (%1%)")}}" -footer "Adventuring | PHB 186" -color <color>
```

#### Usage

``!hd <die> <num>``

``<die>`` - Die size (ex. ``d10``)

``<num>`` - Number of hit dice you are expending (ex. ``2``)

*Example:* ``!hd d10 2``


#### Code

```GN
!alias hd embed {{mod_cc("Hit Dice (%1%)", -%2%, True)}} {{set("heal", vroll("%2%%1%+"+str(constitutionMod*%2%)))}} {{set_hp(min(hp, heal.total + currentHp))}} -title "<name> takes a Short Rest!" -desc "A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. 

For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total." -f "Healing Recieved|{{heal}}" -f "Hit Points|{{get_hp()}} / {{hp}}" -f "Hit Dice (%1%)|{{get_cc("Hit Dice (%1%)")}} / {{get_cc_max("Hit Dice (%1%)")}}" -footer "Adventuring | PHB 186" -color <color>
```

## Second Wind

Displays text and page number for Second Wind. Rolls 1d10 + your fighter level and adds the result to your current hit points. Subtracts 1 from Second Wind counter. Returns error if Second Wind is already used.

#### Prerequisites

A DiceCloud feature called "Second Wind" with ``1`` use, with the words ``short rest`` in it. Alternatively, run the following code.

```GN
!cc create "Second Wind" -min 0 -max 1 -reset short -type bubble
```

To reset your Second Wind, type ``!g [shortrest|sr]`` or ``!g [longrest|lr]``.

#### Code

If your sheet is on DiceCloud, use the DiceCloud box. Otherwise, use the Alternative box.

###### DiceCloud

```GN
!alias bsw embed {{set("counter", "Second Wind")}} {{mod_cc(counter, -1, True)}} {{set("lvl", FighterLevel)}} {{set("heal", vroll("1d10+"+str(lvl)))}} {{set_hp(min(hp, heal.total + currentHp))}} -title "<name> uses {{counter}}!" -desc "On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again." -f "Healing Recieved|{{str(heal)}}" -f "Hit Points|{{get_hp()}} / {{hp}}" -f "{{counter}}|〇" -footer "The Fighter | PHB 72" -color <color>

## Action Surge

Displays text and page number for Action Surge. Subtracts 1 from Action Surge counter. Returns error if no uses of Action Surge left.

#### Prerequisites

A DiceCloud feature called "Action Surge" with ``1+floor(FighterLevel/17)`` uses, with the words ``short rest`` in it. Alternatively, run the following code, replacing ``<uses>`` with the number of Action Surge uses you have.

```GN
!cc create "Action Surge" -min 0 -max <uses> -reset short -type bubble
```

#### Code

```GN
!alias bas embed {{set("counter", "Action Surge")}} {{mod_cc(counter, -1, True)}} -title "<name> uses {{counter}}!" -desc "On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again." -f "{{counter}}|{{'◉'*get_cc(counter) + '〇'*(get_cc_max(counter)-get_cc(counter))}}" -footer "The Fighter | PHB 72" -color <color>

If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest." -f "{{counter}}|{{'◉'*get_cc(counter) + '〇'*(get_cc_max(counter)-get_cc(counter))}}" -footer "The Fighter | PHB 72" -color <color>
