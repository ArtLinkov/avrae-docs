**More Attacks!** (for gsheet and pdfsheet users!)  
*By silverbass#2407*  
  
They're server aliases! You can try them out using ``!wep`` or ``!wa``, and find the aliases with ``!servalias wep`` and ``!servalias wa``  
  
These can be used off-turn (opportunity attacks)! Never get tripped up by that pesky ``!i aoo`` command again!  
Plays nice with snippets like sneak attack, great weapon master, sharpshooter, booming blade, etc!  
  
Add attacks with ``!wep "Rapier of Coolness" 1d8 piercing finesse -b 2 -d 2``  
Remove attacks with ``!wep delete "Rapier of Coolness"`` <--- you can also just do ``!wep delete rap`` and it'll also recognize it  
View your attacks with just ``!wep``  
  
Make a weapon attack (in initiative) with ``!wa target weapon``, like ``!wa Wolf rapier``. It'll recognize if you just type out the first bit  
WORKS OFF TURN TOO! With the same syntax
